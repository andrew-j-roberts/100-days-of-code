# Log - 100 Days Of Code

### Day 0: May 22, Wednesday

**Today's topic**:  
Project setup

**Notes**:     
- Put some thought into how I'd like to do this challenge, and then formalized a set of rules for myself
- Brainstormed a list of topics that I think I should learn about

**What I completed**:   
- 100-days-of-code GitHub repo
- README.md — TOC, rules, and topics

# START!

<h3 id="r1d1">Day 1: May 29, Wednesday</h3>

**Today's topic**:  
Machine learning fundamentals

**Notes**:     
- Decided that my machine learning fundamentals study would have to start with a basic fundamental understanding of AI; I should be able to answer the question "What is AI?" articulately
- Wikipedia gives a great overview of AI. It includes: the history of AI, definitions, basics, problems, approaches, tools, etc.
- I'd recommend reading through it if you want to understand what people mean when they start tossing around tech buzz words 

**What I completed**:   
- Read through the artificial intelligence Wikipedia page   
- Wrote some notes on things I thought were interesting

<h3 id="r1d2">Day 2: May 30, Thursday</h3>

**Today's topic**:  
Machine learning fundamentals

**Notes**:     
- Decided I wanted to continue learning about some machine learning fundamentals before getting my hands dirty with code
- Out of the machine learning courses I found, it seemed like Andrew Ng's Stanford University Coursera course was best
- It's free!

**What I completed**:   
- First week of lectures up through the first quiz
- Learned about supervised and unsupervised ML, as well as some of the terminology that goes along with them  
- For supervised learning I covered the differences between real-value output and classification problems
- For unsupervised learning I covered the differences between clustering and non-clustering problems
