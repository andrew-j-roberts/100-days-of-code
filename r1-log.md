# START!

### Day 1: May 29, Thursday

**Today's topic**:  
Machine learning fundamentals

**Notes**:     
- Decided that my machine learning fundamentals study would have to start with a basic fundamental understanding of AI; I should be able to answer the question "What is AI?" articulately
- Wikipedia gives a great overview of AI. It includes: the history of AI, definitions, basics, problems, approaches, tools, etc.
- I'd recommend reading through it if you want to understand what people mean when they start tossing around tech buzz words 

**What I completed**:   
- Read through the artificial intelligence Wikipedia page   
- Wrote some notes on things I thought were interesting
