## Artificial Intelligence Wikipedia notes

Some example capabilities of AI 
- Understanding human speech
- Competing at high levels in strategic games, like chess
- Autonomously operating cars
- Intelligent routing in content delivery networks
- Military simulations

Three different categories of AI
- Analytical
    - consistent with cognitive intelligence, generating a cognitive representation of the world and using learning based on past experience to inform future decisions
- Human-inspired
    - consistent with cognitive and emotional intelligence; understanding human emotions, in addition to cognitive elements, and considering them in their decision making
- Humanized artificial intelligence
    - consistent with all types of human competencies, which are cognitive, emotional, and social; is able to be “self-conscious” and “self-aware” in interactions with others

Traditional problems (goals) of AI research include
- Reasoning
- Knowledge representation
- Planning
- Learning
- NLP
- Perception
- Ability to move and manipulate objects

Related fields include
- Computer science
- Information science
- Mathematics
- Psychology
- Linguistics
- Philosophy
- etc…

“The field was founded on the claim that human intelligence "can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it”

Computer science defines AI research as the study of “intelligent agents”— any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.

Humans also have a powerful mechanism of “folk psychology” that helps them to interpret natural-language sentences such as “The city councilmen refused the demonstrators a permit because they advocated violence”.  (A generic AI has difficulty inferring whether the councilmen or the demonstrators are the ones alleged to be advocating violence).  This lack of “common knowledge” means that AI often makes different mistakes than humans make, in ways that can seem incomprehensible.

Narrow AI vs Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)

In the field of AI, the most difficult problems are informally known as AI-complete or AI-hard, implying that the difficulty of these computational problems is equivalent to that of solving the central artificial intelligence problem—making computers as intelligent as people, or strong AI.  To call a problem AI-complete reflects an attitude that it would not be solved by a simple specific algorithm.

“Many problems in AI can be solved in theory by intelligently searching through many possible solutions:  reasoning can be reduced to performing a search.”

“A Bayesian network, Bayes network, belief network, decision network, Bayes(ian) model, or probabilistic directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of variables and their conditional dependencies via a directed acyclic graph (DAG).”
