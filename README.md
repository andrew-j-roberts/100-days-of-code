# Rules    
These are the rules I am choosing to follow for the next 100 days:

0.  Spend a minimum of either one uninterrupted hour, or one and a half fragmented or distracted hours on:
    - Coding:  hands on keyboard time; the goal is to learn and to produce lots of code
    - Fundamentals study:  self-imposed grad school time; the goal is to both learn about the fundamentals of various technologies and to get used to reading the academic literature in my field of practice
1.  Append an update to log.md and post all code written at the end of each session
2.  Encourage and engage with two other people doing the challenge on Twitter every day
3.  Do not skip three days in a row

# Topics
